    <h3>A colorful spaghetti breakfast for the rambunctious sweet tooth!</h3>
    <p>If you've seen the movie "Elf", you'd know that elves love their sugar. They always try to 
        <br> stick to the four main food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corn, and syrup. 
        <br> This recipe covers two of the four! </p>
    <p>If you haven't seen the movie, then you're in for a treat (literally). Recreate this <i>memorable</i> 
        <br>scene and maybe you'll be bouncing with joy and energy just like Buddy!</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil spaghetti according to the instructions on the package or box, about 10 minutes. 
            <br>(If you throw a noodle at the wall and it <em>sticks</em>, 'tis cooked to <em>perfection</em>.)</li>
        <li>When the pasta is close to being done, put the chocolate fudge Pop Tart in a toaster. 
            <br>After it's toasted, set aside for later.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti noodles in a collander and run cold water over the noodles to prevent over-cooking.</li>
        <li>Place desired amount of noodles on a clean dinner plate.</li>
        <li>Add your toppings: garnish your pasta with M&M's, rainbow sprinkles, and mini marshmallows. 
            <br>Measure with love; the more the merrier (and sweeter)!</li>
        <li>Drizzle (or drench) your spaghetti with the chocolate and maple syrup. 
            <br>Like it <b><em>really</em></b> sweet? Squeeze the bottles until empty.</li>
        <li>Break the Pop Tart into two pieces and place along side your spaghetti. Consider this your toast!</li>
