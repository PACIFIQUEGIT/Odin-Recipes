    <h1>Rachel's Thanksgiving Trifle</h1>
    <img width="560" src="images/thanksgiving-trifle.gif.crdownload" alt="">
    <h2>An iconic holiday food, turned even more iconic-er!</h2>
    <p>If I learned anything from Friends, it's that sticky magazine pages can lead to new and<br>interesting recipes! Rachel's English Trifle is one to remember. It's so good, even the <br><i>birds</i> love it. Don't be like Chandler - if you eat in on the balcony, hold on to your plate <br>or they just might fly off with it and drop it in the street!</p>
    <p>Be prepared to call your friends to tell them how good it is (from your kid's room).. <br>Heck, take it in the bathroom so you can look at it while you eat it! <br>Wherever you decide to eat it, just enjoy!</p>
